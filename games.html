    Fortnite is an online video game developed by Epic Games and released in
    2017. It is available in three distinct game mode versions that otherwise
    share the same general gameplay and game engine: Fortnite: Save the World, a
    cooperative hybrid-tower defense-shooter-survival game for up to four
    players to fight off zombie-like creatures and defend objects with traps and
    fortifications they can build; Fortnite Battle Royale, a free-to-play battle
    royale game in which up to 100 players fight to be the last person standing;
    and Fortnite Creative, in which players are given complete freedom to create
    worlds and battle arenas. Save the World and Battle Royale were released in
    2017 as early access titles, while Creative was released on December 6,
    2018. While the Save the World and Creative versions have been successful
    for Epic Games, Fortnite Battle Royale in particular became an overwhelming
    success and a cultural phenomenon, drawing more than 125 million players in
    less than a year, earning hundreds of millions of dollars per month.
    Fortnite as a whole generated $9 billion in gross revenue up until December
    2019.

    Minecraft is a sandbox video game developed by the Swedish video game
    developer Mojang Studios. The game was created by Markus "Notch" Persson in
    the Java programming language. Following several early private testing
    versions, it was first made public in May 2009 before fully releasing in
    November 2011, with Jens Bergensten then taking over development. Minecraft
    has since been ported to several other platforms and is the best-selling
    video game of all time, with over 238 million copies sold and nearly 140
    million monthly active users as of 2021. <img
